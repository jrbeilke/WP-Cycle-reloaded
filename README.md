# WP-Cycle-reloaded

This is a fork of the WP-Cycle plugin with fixes to work with recent versions of WordPress.

The WP-Cycle plugin allows you to upload images from your computer, which will then be used to generate a jQuery Cycle Plugin slideshow of the images.

Each image can also be given a URL which, when the image is active in the slideshow, will be used as an anchor wrapper around the image, turning the image into a link to the URL you specified.  The slideshow is set to pause when the user hovers over the slideshow images, giving them ample time to click the link.

Images can also be deleted via the plugins Administration page.

## Installation

1. Upload the entire `wp-cycle-reloaded` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Once the `wp-cycle-reloaded` plugin has been installed you can safely remove the previous `wp-cycle` plugin
